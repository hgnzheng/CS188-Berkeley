In this semester's offering, topics differed from previous offerings (30% of the material was focused on RL/ML/DL). Topics include:

- Search                                      (Agents, State Spaces, Rationality, Graph, Tree, A*, Heuristics)
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems            (Forward Checking, Recursive Backtracking, Arc Consistency, MRV/LCV Heuristics)
- Games                                       (MiniMax, Pruning, Adversarial Search)
- Bayesian Networks                           (Variable Elimination, Probabilistic Inference, Rejection, Gibbs, MCMC, Likelihood)
- Hidden Markov Models                        (Particle Filtering, Inference, Smoothing, Prediction, Dynamic Bayes Nets)
- Markov Decision Processes                   (Policies, Q-Values, Value & Policy Iteration)
- Reinforcement Learning                      (TD, Q-Learning, Policy Gradients)
- Machine Learning                            (Perceptrons, Classification Methods, Regularization, Smoothing, MLE, Loss Functions)
- Neural Networks                             (Architecture, Forward/Back-Propogation, Representation)
- Optimization Methods                        (Stochastic, Mini-Batch, Newton's Method & 2nd Order, Momentum, Adaptive)

## Projects

*My project partner was Nate del Rosario | [Github](https://github.com/natdosan). The solutions in the repository is the collective effort between us.*

### [Project 0](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj0/)
- Basic Python setup to prepare for the upcoming projects.

### [Project 1](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj1/)
- Implemented different search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, and designed admissible / consistent heuristics to achieve optimal solutions.

### [Project 2](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj2/)
- Implemented different a Reflex Agent as well as Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax, and an evaluation function.

### [Project 3](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj3/) & [Project 4](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj4/)
- Implemented variable elimination and the Forward Algorithm for particle filtering.

### [Project 5](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj5/)
- Implemented value iteration, Q-Learning, Epsilon Greedy Exploration / Exploitation, and Approximate Q-Learning.

### [Project 6](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su23/projects/proj6/)
